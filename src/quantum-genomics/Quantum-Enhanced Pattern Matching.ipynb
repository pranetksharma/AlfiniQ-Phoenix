    "# Quantum-Enhanced Pattern-Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of AlfiniQ ends with an efficient DNA search of the person we are attempting to determine the futures for. This is a computationally intensive task for classical computers, and the entire process of sequencing and analysis can often take weeks. Through our quantum acceleration, we aim to reduce this time to days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does classical DNA Pattern-Matching work?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Sequence Alignment**\n",
    "- **Input**: Set of DNA sequencing reads.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Align reads to a reference genome.\n",
    "- **Process**: Algorithms match reads to the genome considering mismatches, insertions, and deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Gene Prediction**\n",
    "- **Input**: Aligned sequencing reads.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Predict gene locations and structures.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Identify Open Reading Frames (ORFs).\n",
    "  - Recognize start and stop codons.\n",
    "  - Predict splice sites (for eukaryotic genomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Validation and Experimental Follow-Up**\n",
    "- **Output**: List of predicted genes.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Experimentally validate predicted genes.\n",
    "- **Process**:\n",
    "  - Perform RT-PCR, gene knockout, or functional assays.\n",
    "  - Confirm gene existence and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is quantum computing involved?\n",
    "\n",
    "If this sounds like a problem uniquely solvable using Grover search, you would be correct! However, a naive Grover search will not get you very far in achieving the efficiency that you desire for genome search. Instead, there are some ways we can tune our algorithm to better suit the specific use case. A graduate student at TU Delft explored this problem for his Master's thesis, and our work was accomplished by standing on his shoulders for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Oracle Call\n",
    "This approach adapts Grover's algorithm for pattern matching, where the quantum oracle is specialized for marking specific solutions that correspond to the pattern being searched. The algorithm initializes a quantum state in superposition over all possible indices in the search space. The oracle then marks the states where the pattern matches the search space. This is not a direct use of Grover's search; instead, it adapts the oracle to work specifically with pattern indices rather than with direct data comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Phone Directory and Hamming Distance\n",
    "This method encodes a database as a set of indices and patterns. The search algorithm evolves the patterns to calculate their Hamming distance from a query pattern. This approach uses quantum parallelism to calculate distances across all entries simultaneously, making it highly efficient for problems where an exact match is sought.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Associative Memory\n",
    "This method uses a combination of two types of quantum oracles: one to mark the desired pattern and another to mark all stored patterns in memory. This approach aims to achieve higher solution probabilities and allows for the retrieval of patterns based on partial matches. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the pattern may have errors or only partial information is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these methods leverages the inherent parallelism of quantum computing to significantly speed up the search process compared to classical algorithms. They utilize quantum states to represent and process all possible matches simultaneously, reducing the number of steps required to find a match. This is why quantum pattern matching can potentially outperform classical algorithms, especially as the size of the data grows.\n",
