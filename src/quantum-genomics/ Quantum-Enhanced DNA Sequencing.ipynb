    "# Quantum-Enhanced DNA Sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of AlfiniQ begins with an efficient DNA sequencing of the person we are attempting to determine the futures for. There are two primary techniques for DNA sequencing: reference-guided and de novo. We will briefly describe the differences between both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference-guided vs. De Novo DNA Sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference-guided DNA Sequencing\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Reference-guided sequencing involves aligning sequence reads obtained from a sample against a known reference genome.\n",
    "- **Process**: Sequence reads are compared to a pre-existing genome sequence serving as a reference to identify variations.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - **Speed**: Faster due to alignment to a known template rather than de novo assembly.\n",
    "  - **Efficiency**: Requires less computational power and memory.\n",
    "  - **Detection of Variations**: Efficient detection of variants by comparing to a known standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### De Novo DNA Sequencing\n",
    "- **Explanation**: De Novo sequencing involves assembling the entire genome sequence from scratch without using a reference genome.\n",
    "- **Process**: Piecing together short DNA reads into longer sequences to reconstruct the genome.\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - **Unbiased**: Reveals novel genetic information without relying on existing references.\n",
    "  - **Discovery**: Identifies novel genes, structural variations, and genetic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Reference-based Sequencing is Faster**:\n",
    "Reference-based sequencing is faster because it leverages existing information from a known genome sequence. Instead of reconstructing the entire genome from scratch, it pieces together unique elements from the genome of interest to insert into the \"reference\" human genome to accurately and quickly construct the genome of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is quantum computing involved?\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher at the Democritus University of Thrace, working with the consulting firm Ernst and Young, developed a theoretical quantum algorithm that sequences DNA through reference guiding. Working from the theory that the paper describes, we wrote our algorithm that efficiently constructs genomes in $O\\left(\\frac{n}{m\\cdot k}\\right)$ time (where we are attempting to insert $n$ reads—sequences unique to the person—into $k$ sequences, with $m$ representing the superposition of the reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the quantum algorithm described in the paper uses a quantum compare operator and a quantum shift operator to simultaneously evaluate multiple potential alignments between a DNA read sequence and a reference sequence. This method stands out because it allows the exploration of all possible alignments concurrently rather than sequentially, as is the case with classical algorithms. The quantum approach significantly reduces the computational complexity involved in finding the optimal alignment, providing a theoretical quadratic speedup in search capabilities due to the quantum parallelism, which is a substantial improvement over traditional methods that generally require linear or super-linear time complexity. This makes the quantum method superior for handling large genomic datasets, where the volume and complexity of data can be overwhelmingly extensive.\n",
